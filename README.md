# Parsers-js

This repository contains three parsers created to automate data extraction from invoices. Two formats are included: .xml and .pdf
All three scripts were made in the google spreadsheets apps script extension to run functions within the google drive environment. The objective was to parse files, extract the desired data, and paste that data into google spreadsheet cells. The users defined the custom structure and the programs were modified accordingly.

The XML parsers include one that parses concepts and one that only parses general invoice data.
